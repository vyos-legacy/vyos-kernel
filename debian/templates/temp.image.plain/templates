Description:  You are installing a kernel with an initrd image
 You are attempting to install an initrd kernel image (version
 =V) on a machine currently running kernel version
 ${hostversion}.
 .
 I have been unable to find a suitable tool for generating initrd images
 (I looked at the list "${ramdisk}")
 This will break the installation, unless such tools are also being installed
 right now in the same run. (This means, one from the following list
 ${initrddep})

Template: =ST-image-=V/preinst/lilo-has-ramdisk
Type: text
Description:  Lilo has a ramdisk line, which should be commented or removed
 I have found a line
 ${LINE}
 in /etc/lilo.conf that should be removed or commented out, since you are using 
 initrd/initramfs.

Template: =ST-image-=V/preinst/abort-install-=V
Type: note
Description:  Aborting install since loading an initrd kernel image
 You are attempting to install an initrd kernel image (version
 =V) This will not work unless you have configured your boot
 loader to use initrd. (An initrd image is a kernel image that expects
 to use an INITial Ram Disk to mount a minimal root file system into
 RAM and use that for booting). Unfortunately, since this Question
 pertaining to this was not shown, and the default action is to abort
 the install. =ST-image-=V aborted.


Template: =ST-image-=V/preinst/failed-to-move-modules-=V
Type: note
Description:  Failed to move modules out of the way, aborting
 You are attempting to install a kernel image (version =V)
 However, the directory ${modules_base}/=V/kernel still exists.
 .
 As you have instructed, an attempt was made to move the directory out
 of the way. Unfortunately, There was a problem moving
 ${modules_base}/=V to ${modules_base}/${dest}.
 .
 I suggest you move $modules_base/$version out of the way manually,
 and then try re-installing this image.
 .
 I am aborting.

Template: =ST-image-=V/preinst/overwriting-modules-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description:  Stop install since the kernel-image is already installed?
 You are attempting to install a kernel image (version =V)
 However, the directory ${modules_base}/=V/kernel still exists.  If this
 directory belongs to a previous ${package} package, and if
 you have deselected some modules, or installed standalone modules
 packages, this could be bad. 
 .
 If ${modules_base}/=V/kernel belongs to a old install of
 ${package}, then this is your last chance to abort the
 installation of this kernel image (nothing has been changed yet).
 .
 If you know what you are doing, and if you feel that this
 image should be installed despite this anomaly, Please answer n to the
 question.
 .
 Otherwise, I suggest you move ${modules_base}/=V/kernel out of the way,
 perhaps to ${modules_base}/=V.kernel.old or something, and then try
 re-installing this image.

Template: =ST-image-=V/preinst/abort-overwrite-=V
Type: note
Description:  Aborting install since modules exist
 You are attempting to install an initrd kernel image (version
 =V). However, the corresponding kernel modules directory exists, 
 and there was no permission given to silently delete the modules 
 directory.  Unfortunately, since this Question
 pertaining to this was not shown, and the default action is to abort
 the install. =ST-image-=V aborted.


Template: =ST-image-=V/preinst/already-running-this-=V
Type: note
Description:  The kernel version running is the same as the one being installed
 You are attempting to install a kernel version that is the same as
 the version you are currently running (version ${running}). The modules
 list is quite likely to have been changed, and the modules dependency
 file ${modules_base}/=V/modules.dep needs to be re-built. It can
 not be built correctly right now, since the module list for the
 running kernel are likely to be different from the kernel installed.
 I am creating a new modules.dep file, but that may not be
 correct. It shall be regenerated correctly at next reboot.
 .
 I repeat: you have to reboot in order for the modules file to be
 created correctly. Until you reboot, it may be impossible to load
 some modules. Reboot as soon as this install is finished (Do not
 reboot right now, since you may not be able to boot back up until
 installation is over, but boot immediately after). I can not stress
 that too much. You need to reboot soon.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/create-kimage-link-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description:  Create a symbolic link to the current kernel image?
 I notice that you do not have ${kimage} symbolic link. I can create one 
 for you, and it shall be updated by newer kernel image packages. This is
 useful if you use a boot loader like lilo.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/kimage-is-a-directory
Type: note
Description:  Image symbolic link destination is a directory, aborting
 ${kimage} is a directory, which I did not expect.  I am trying to create a
 symbolic link with that name linked to ${image_dest}. Since a directory
 exists here, my assumptions are way off, and I am aborting.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/depmod-error-=V
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description:  Do you want to abort now?
 This may be benign, (You may have versioned symbol names, for instance).
 Or this could be an error. depmod exited with return value ${exit_value}
 ${SIGNAL}${CORE}. 
 I am deleting the file ${modules_base}/=V/modules.dep. However, 
 since depmod is run at install time, we could just defer running depmod.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/depmod-error-initrd-=V
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description:  Do you want to abort now?
 This may be benign, (You may have versioned symbol names, for instance).
 Or this could be an error. depmod exited with return value ${exit_value}
 . ${SIGNAL} ${CORE}
 Since this image uses initrd, I am not deleting the file
 ${modules_base}/=V/modules.dep. However, there is no guarantee that the 
 file is valid. I would strongly advice you to either abort and fix the
 errors in depmod, or regenerate the initrd image with a known good 
 modules.dep file. I repeat, an initrd kernel image with a bad modules.dep
 shall fail to boot.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/old-initrd-link-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description:  Should the old initrd link be deleted now?
 I note that you have an old initrd symbolic link in place. The name of
 the symbolic link is being changed to initrd.img. If the old link is
 deleted, you may have to update the boot loader. If the link is left in
 place, it will point to the wrong image.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/old-dir-initrd-link-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description:  Should the old initrd link be deleted now?
 I note that you have an old ${image_dir}/initrd symbolic link in
 place.  The location of the symbolic link is now the same location as
 the kernel image symbolic links, namely, in ${image_dest}.  If the old
 link is deleted, you may have to update the boot loader. If the link
 is left in place, it will point to the wrong image.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/old-system-map-link-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description:  Should the old /System.map link be deleted now?
 You have /System.map symbolic link. These were installed by ancient 
 kernel image packages. However, all the programs that look at the 
 information in the map files (including top, ps, and klogd) 
 also will look at /boot/System.map-=V
 Having the symbolic link in / is technically detrimental
 (apart from cluttering up /); many programs, though looking in /boot,
 still allow /System.map to override. If you install multiple kernels
 on this machine, then the /System.map symbolic link only
 applies to one such kernel, for all other choices the symbols loaded
 will be wrong. Not having /System.map at all prevents this.

Template: shared/kernel-image/really-run-bootloader
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Run the default bootloader?
 The default boot loader for this architecture is $loader, which is
 present. However, you have not explicitly requested the boot loader 
 $loader should be run in the configuration file /etc/kernel-img.conf,
 and you seem to have grub installed, and have set a postinst hook
 (which is used to hook in grub after a kernel image installation). At 
 this point, it is perfectly likely that this system is using grub as a
 bootloader, and not the builtin default of $loader. If that is the case,
 running $loader instead of grub might make the machine unbootable. I need
 to know whether to run the default bootloader $loader, or just let the
 postinst hook script update grub later. The default is to run $loader.


Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/bootloader-test-error-=V
Type: note
Description:  Error running the boot loader in test mode.
 An error occurred while running the boot loader ${loader} in test mode.
 A log is available in ${temp_file_name}. Please edit /etc/${loader}.conf
 manually and re-run ${loader}, or make other arrangements to boot your machine.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/bootloader-error-=V

 A log is available in ${temp_file_name}. Please edit /etc/${loader}.conf
 manually and re-run ${loader}, or make other arrangements to boot your machine.

Template: =ST-image-=V/prerm/removing-running-kernel-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description:  Do you want to abort removal now?
 You are running a kernel (version ${running}) and attempting to remove
 the same version. This is a potentially disastrous action. Not only
 will /boot/vmlinuz-${running} be removed, making it impossible to boot
 it, (you will have to take action to change your boot loader to boot
 a new kernel), it will also remove all modules under the directory
 /lib/modules/${running}. Just having a copy of the kernel image is not
 enough, you will have to replace the modules too.
 .
 I repeat, this is very dangerous. If at all in doubt, answer Yes. If
 you know exactly what you are doing, and are prepared to hose your
 system, then answer No.

Template: =ST-image-=V/prerm/would-invalidate-boot-loader-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description:  Do you want to abort removal now?
 You have a valid /etc/${loader}.conf file that mentions
 ${kimage}-=V.  Removing =ST-image-=V would invalidate
 that file. (you will have to edit /etc/${loader}.conf or re-target
 symbolic links mentioned there (typically, /vmlinuz and /vmlinuz.old)
 to not refer to ${kimage}-=V and will have to re-run ${loader}). 
 .
 I repeat: you shall have to make changes to your boot loader setup
 and will have to re-run ${loader}.
